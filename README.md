# Pianista

## Why Pianista?
Have you ever come to a point in life where you came across a nice song and you just wish to play it on a piano even if you don't know how to play one ? But then you try to seek people who can teach you (just that song on the piano) and you can't find anyone since they only offer their pre-customized courses where you only have few choices to select from. So from now on don't worry, Pianista got your back !!
